# Customer_segments_from_mobile_activity
Self-project. I am seeking to showcase my skills in a way that will be appealing to potential employers. A data analysis and machine learning project with real-world applications.


## Problem statement
An analytics company focused on mobile user behavior. They analyze data about how people use their phones and provide insights to handset manufacturers and app developers. The latest goal is customer segmentation.
We want to understand if there are groups of users who behave in a similar way.
Knowing these user segments would be useful because their clients could target entire user bases with different initiatives.
with different initiatives.


## Datasets
Our original dataset has the following structure:

| Column Name   | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `User ID`  | Unique id for user's    |
| `Session ID`        | Uniquely identify a user’s activity session            |
| `Timestamp`         | Date and time of an individual event |
| `App Name`      | The name of the app in use |
| `Event Type`  | Values are one of the following: “Opened”, “Closed”, “User Interaction”, or “Broken” |

There is another data set called App_categories. The data is generated using ChatGPT prompts. Each app is assigned to a specific category.

## Desired outcomes
The end result is the definition of our user segments - that is, what factors describe each segment and which users belong to which group.
