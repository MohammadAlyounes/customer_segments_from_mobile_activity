|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `User ID`  | Unique id for user's    |
| `Session ID`        | Uniquely identify a user’s activity session            |
| `Timestamp`         | Date and time of an individual event |
| `App Name`      | The name of the app in use |
| `Event Type`  | Values are one of the following: “Opened”, “Closed”, “User Interaction”, or “Broken” |

There is another data set called App_categories. The data is generated using ChatGPT prompts. Each app is assigned to a specific category.

## Desired outcomes
